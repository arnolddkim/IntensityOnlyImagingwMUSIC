# IntensityOnlyImagingwMUSIC
Collection of Matlab codes used to compute the examples shown in the paper, "Intensity-only inverse scattering using MUSIC" by A. D. Kim and C. Tsogka (2019).

The codes are currently set to compute the 8 ellipsoids problem.
1. ForwardProblem3D.m computes the solution of the forward problem for the suite of experiments corresponding to different incident fields.
2. ComputeMUSICImage.m computes the imaging procedure given in Section 3 of "Intensity-only inverse scattering using MUSIC" by A. D. Kim and C. Tsogka.
3. PlotIsosurface.m plots the isosurface of the imaging result from ComputeMUSICImage.m to serve as the reconstructed image of the scattering objects.
